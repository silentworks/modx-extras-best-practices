# Welcome

There's a lot of outdated information on the MODX documentation website and getting access requires
a user to first ask permission. Since MODX is a opensource project we think everyone should have
access to this and it should be easier to contribute document to a platform without access being
granted.


## Special Thanks

Thanks to the Josh Lockhart for allowing us to use his [PHP The Right Way](http://www.phptherightway.com) 
Jekyll theme for this website.

## Disclaimer

We are not claiming to be the best at what we do nor are we saying you have to follow these rules, we
just think that documentation surrounding creating an Extra for MODX is a bit limited.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information and examples as they become
available.

## How to Contribute

Help make this website the best resource for new MODX Extra developers! [Contribute on GitHub][1]
