is something all developers try to avoid. Here I will list a few tool that will help to make your
workflow easier when developing extras.

* [MyComponent][mycomponent] - developed by Bob Ray
* RepoMan - developed by Everett Griffiths (Link coming soon)
* Builder - developed by Alan Pich (Link coming soon)
