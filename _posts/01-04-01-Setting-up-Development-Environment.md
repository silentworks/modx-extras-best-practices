## Setting up Development Environment {#setting_up_development_environment}

When developing Extras in MODX it is good to have your extra outside of your actual [MODX][modx] site root,
this will allow you to easily move your development for the Extra to new versions of [MODX][modx]
without worrying about copying files from different directories.
