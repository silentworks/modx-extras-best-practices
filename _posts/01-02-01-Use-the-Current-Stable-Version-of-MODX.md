## Use the Current Stable Version of MODX (2.2.6) {#use_the_current_stable_version_54_title}

When developing an Extra in [MODX][modx] always use the current stable version to keep your Extras up to date and 
working with new releases. These up to date current stable versions also provide a host of bug fixes and are 
normally more secure than previous versions.

Each major release provides more functionality and make many tasks less tedious to accomplish.
