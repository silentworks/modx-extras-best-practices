# MODX Extras Best Practices

## Overview

This is the GitHub Pages repository for the _PHP: The Right Way_ project.

* This website is a Jekyll project.
* Each section and sub-section are a Markdown file in `_posts/`.
* Sub-sections have `isChild: true` in their front matter.
* The navigation and page structure are automatically generated.


## How to contribute

1. Fork and edit
2. Optionally install [Ruby](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) gem to preview locally
3. Send Pull request for consideration

### Contributor Style Guide

1. Use American English spelling (*primary English repo only*)
2. Use four (4) spaces to indent text; do not use tabs.
3. Wrap all text to 120 characters.
4. Code samples should adhere to PSR-1 or higher.

## Why

The [MODX][] community have seen a increase in Add-on being developed for the system. There are currently no up-to-date definitive guide on developing Add-ons for [MODX][]. 
We want developers who have experienced the bad and good to contribute what they have learnt from their experience to help others.
